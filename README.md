# [Windows Server 2022 STIG PowerShell Hardening Scripts](https://github.com/KennethClendenin/stig-winserver2022-hardening/tree/main/scripts)

This repository contains PowerShell scripts developed to implement specific Windows Server 2022 security controls, based on guidance from [STIGAVIEW](https://stigaview.com/), which references DISA STIGs (Security Technical Implementation Guides - V2R4).

Each script focuses on a single control, uses a modular structure, and includes optional toggles for lab testing or demonstration purposes.

ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose:** Automate the application of STIG control implementations in Windows Server 2022 environments using auditable, maintainable, and enterprise-ready PowerShell scripts.
